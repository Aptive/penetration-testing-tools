# Penetration Testing Tools Repo

The purpose of this project is to make a single repository for all the commonly used penetration testing tools, typically tools that don't exist within Kali or other penetration testing distros. In some cases, it makes sense to have the latest version of a tool separate to your distro installed stable binaries or scripts. Installing from GitHub allows you to grab the latest tools specific to your style of pen testing, tools that could be too niche to ever make it into your favorite security distro. Additionally, a seperate self-contained tool set within your home directory or /opt also allows for easy transportation from one (identical) machine to another.

## Installation Instructions

1. Fork repo (allows you to make changes to your tools and or push to this repo) 
2. Git clone repo: 
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Aptive/penetration-testing-tools.git
``` 

For some tools further installation will be required, e.g. building binaries / installing configuring tools to suit your requirements, below are links to each distro managers page with installation instructions for each.

## Update Instructions 

### Update a single tool 

The following example uses nmap:

```bash
cd penetration-testing-tools/infra/nmap/
git pull
```

### Update all the pen test tools 

```bash
cd penetration-testing-tools/
git submodule foreach git pull
```
